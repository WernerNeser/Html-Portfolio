<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<P>
    In 1988, following his mother's death, the child Peter Quill is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of alien thieves 
    and smugglers led by Yondu Udonta. In 2014, on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious Orb, but is attacked by 
    forces of the fanatical Kree renegade Ronan the Accuser led by Korath. Although Quill escapes with the Orb, Yondu discovers
     his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the Orb.
</P>
<P>
When Quill attempts to sell the Orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, 
drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket and the tree-like humanoid Groot. 
Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. An inmate, Drax the Destroyer, attempts to kill Gamora 
due to her association with Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, 
though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the Orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to 
sell the Orb to the Collector Taneleer Tivan, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship,
 the Milano.
</P>
<P>
Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flees to Knowhere, a remote lawless outpost. 
A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meets Tivan. Tivan opens the Orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, 
an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, 
triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's collection. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, 
pursued by Ronan's followers, including Gamora's adoptive sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space,
 and Ronan's fighters capture the Orb.
</P>
<P>
Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. 
Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the Orb to Yondu.
 Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy.
  On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself.\
   He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar. Hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.
</P>
<P>
The Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the warship 
with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, 
who escapes, but the group finds themselves outmatched by Ronan's power. Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. 
The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and 
prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone,
 and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.
</P>
<P>
Quill gives Yondu a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real one to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar,
 Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as 
 the Guardians of the Galaxy, has their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part 
 of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother, a cassette tape filled with her 
 favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a potted sapling cut from Groot, which grows into a baby version
  of him.
</P>

<h3>Goonies</h3>
<P>
Facing foreclosure of their homes in the "Goon Docks" area of Astoria, Oregon, to an expanding country club, a group of children who 
call themselves "the Goonies" (Mikey, Data, Mouth, and Chunk) gather for a final weekend together.
</P>
<P>
Rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they come across a 1632 doubloon and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the treasure of 
legendary pirate "One-Eyed Willy", believed to be located somewhere nearby. Mikey considers One-Eyed Willy to be the original Goonie. 
Seeing the treasure as their last chance to save their homes, the kids overpower and bind Mikey's older brother Brand and make their 
way to an abandoned restaurant on the coast that coincides with the map. Brand soon follows alongside Andy, a cheerleader with a crush 
on him; and Stef, Andy's friend.
</P>
<P>
The group eventually discovers that the derelict restaurant is a hideout of the Fratelli crime family: Francis, Jake, and their mother.
 The Goonies find a tunnel in the basement and follow it, but Chunk leaves to alert the police. When Chunk flags down a motorist to go 
 to the sheriff's station, it turns out to be the Fratellis who imprison him with their hulking, deformed, younger brother Sloth. 
 The Fratellis interrogate Chunk until he reveals where the Goonies have gone, and begin pursuit. Chunk is left behind with Sloth, 
 whom he befriends. After Sloth frees both of them, Chunk calls the sheriff, who thinks it is another one of Chunk's tall tales.
  Chunk and Sloth follow the trail of the Fratellis.
</P>
<P>
The Goonies evade several deadly booby traps along the tunnels, while barely staying ahead of the Fratellis. They finally reach the 
grotto where Willy's pirate ship, The Inferno, is anchored. The group discovers that the ship is filled with treasure, and they start
 filling their pockets, but Mikey warns them not to take any on a set of scales in front of Willy's skeleton, considering that to be
  their tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
As the Goonies are planning their escape, the Fratellis appear and strip them of their loot. The Fratellis start to bind the Goonies'
 hands and make them walk the plank until Chunk and Sloth arrive and distract the Fratellis long enough for the Goonies to jump 
 overboard and swim to safety. Brand saves Andy from drowning and they kiss. The Fratellis proceed to grab all the treasure they can,
  including those on Willy's scales; this triggers another booby trap, which causes the grotto to cave in. With Sloth's help, the 
  Goonies and Fratellis barely escape.
</P>
<P>
The two groups emerge on Astoria's beach, where the Goonies reunite with their families and the police. The Fratellis are arrested,
but Chunk prevents Sloth from also being taken; he invites Sloth to live with him, which Sloth accepts. Just as Mikey's father is
 about to sign the foreclosure papers, the Walshes' housekeeper Rosalita discovers that Mikey's marble bag is filled with gems he 
 took from the ship that had not been seized by the Fratellis. Mikey's father triumphantly rips up the papers, declaring that they
  have enough money to negate the foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
As the Goonies are recounting their adventure to the disbelieving press and police, everyone's attention is drawn to the Inferno,
 having broken free of the grotto, sailing off majestically on its own in the distance.
</P>

<h3>Ghostbusters</h3>
<P>
After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with 
a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires
them. The trio responds by establishing "Ghostbusters", a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused
 firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.
</P>
<P>
Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic
 dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: "Zuul". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building while 
 Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost, 
 Slimer, from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy 
 streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an 
 ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become
  famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand.
</P>
<P>
Suspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter 
rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter
 meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to "Gozer the Gozerian", a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be "the Gatekeeper". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is "Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster". The Ghostbusters agree to keep the pair separated.
</P>
<P>
Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, 
causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment
 building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th
  century, designed Dana's building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and
   bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.
</P>
<P>
The Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between 
dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they
 attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters "choose the form of the destructor". Ray inadvertently
  recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins
   destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional
    gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. 
    The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.
